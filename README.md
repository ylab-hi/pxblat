## Why PxBLAT?

When conducting extensive queries, using the `blat` of `BLAT` suite can prove to be quite inefficient, especially if these operations aren't grouped. The tasks are allocated sporadically, often interspersed among other tasks.
In general, the choice narrows down to either utilizing `blat` or combining `gfServer` with `gfClient`.
Indeed, `blat` is a program that launches `gfServer`, conducts the sequence query via `gfClient`, and then proceeds to terminate the server.

This approach is far from ideal when performing numerous queries that aren't grouped since `blat` repeatedly initializes and shuts down `gfServer` for each query, resulting in substantial overhead.
This overhead consists of the time required for the server to index the reference, contingent on the reference's size.
To index the human genome (hg38), for example, would take approximately five minutes.

A more efficient solution would involve initializing `gfServer` once and invoking `gfClient` multiple times for the queries.
However, `gfServer` and `gfClient` are only accessible via the command line.
This necessitates managing system calls (for instance, `subprocess` or `os.system`), intermediate temporary files, and format conversion, further diminishing performance.

That is why `PxBLAT` holds its position.
It resolves the issues mentioned above while introducing handy features like `port retry`, `use current running server`, etc.

1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```

4. Take changes to the project's codebase.
5. Install the latest package

```bash
uv sync
```

6. Test your changes

```bash
pytest -vlsx tests
```

7. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.
